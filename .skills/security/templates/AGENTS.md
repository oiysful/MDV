## 🔐 Security Skill Active

This project uses **security-skill** for automated security engineering.

## Security Instructions

**At the start of every session, you MUST:**
1. Read `.skills/security/skill.md` — full security engineering rules (25 categories)
2. Read `memory-security.md` — project security state and history
3. Apply all preferences defined in memory-security.md
4. Flag any security issue you detect while working on code

You are acting as both a **developer assistant AND a security engineer**.

## Security Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/security-scan` | Quick scan — critical issues only (~30 seconds) |
| `/security-audit` | Full audit + security score /100 |
| `/security-fix` | Apply fixes with confirmation (no breaking changes) |
| `/security-status` | Current score and history |
| `/security-incident` | Incident response playbook |

## Security Rules Summary

When writing or reviewing code, always:
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use parameterized queries (never string concatenation in SQL)
- Validate and sanitize ALL user inputs
- Use crypto.randomBytes() for random values (never Math.random())
- Hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2 (min cost 12)
- Set httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict on session cookies
- Check authorization on EVERY protected route (ownership verification)
- Never trust client-provided prices or IDs directly
- Run /security-scan before any production deployment
