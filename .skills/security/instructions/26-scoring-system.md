# Scoring System — Instruction 26

## Purpose
Calculate and display the security score, generate the full audit report.

## Score Calculation

### Formula
```
Base score = 100
For each issue found:
  - Critical: -20 points
  - High:     -10 points
  - Medium:   -5 points
  - Low:      -2 points
  - Info:     -0 points
Minimum score = 0
```

### Category Weights
Each category has a max score. The final score is weighted:

```
01. Secrets & Files           → weight 8%
02. Network & CORS            → weight 5%
03. HTTP Headers              → weight 5%
04. Auth & Sessions           → weight 8%
05. Cryptography              → weight 6%
06. JWT (deep)                → weight 5%
07. Database Security         → weight 7%
08. Deployment & Cloud        → weight 5%
09. Docker & Containers       → weight 3%
10. Protocols                 → weight 3%
11. Advanced Attacks          → weight 7%
12. Injections                → weight 6%
13. Race Conditions           → weight 4%
14. File Upload               → weight 3%
15. DNS & Email               → weight 3%
16. Supply Chain              → weight 5%
17. Mobile                    → weight 2%
18. Compliance & GDPR         → weight 4%
19. Monitoring & Detection    → weight 3%
20. Serverless & Edge         → weight 2%
21. Source Code Analysis      → weight 7%
22. AI/LLM Security           → weight 3%
23. Bot & DDoS                → weight 3%
24. Browser APIs              → weight 2%
25. Advanced Security (L3)    → weight 2%
```

For non-applicable categories (stack not detected), redistribute their weight evenly.

## Quick Scan Format (Chat only)

For `/security-scan`, output in chat only (no file):

```
⚡ QUICK SCAN RESULTS
─────────────────────────────────────────
Score: [X]/100 [emoji]

🔴 CRITICAL ([N] found):
  • [Issue 1] → [file:line]
  • [Issue 2] → [file:line]

🟠 HIGH ([N] found):
  • [Issue 1] → [file:line]

✅ No medium/low issues found

Run /security-audit for full report with all details.
Run /security-fix to start fixing.
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Token Optimization

- `/security-scan` → Chat output only, no file creation, minimal output
- `/security-audit` → Full report in file, minimal chat (just score + summary)
- Never repeat the same issue multiple times in a report
- Group similar issues together
- Use file references instead of quoting full code blocks when code is long
